    <h2>Your coding future is here.</h2>
    <p>
    When you started to think about how to program computers, you may be thinking this all is very difficult.
     Where do I start? How can I get any where? Can I do anything cool? Well that is where we come in. 
    We will start you of in Scratch, then start to move you on to stuff like HTML CSS and JQuery. 
    You will get to work with databases, and applications that will let you develop some professional looking 
    projects. We are coders and have been working in the industry for many years. We are asked how to develop 
    all sorts of applications, so let's start   teaching you how to do it.

      <h2>Why Zero2coding?</h2>
          <p>
           We are just here to help you, it is not possible to help others without resources, so we do charge for 
           most of the help we give you. What is important to us, is to keep the charges as low as we can, 
           without compromising on quality. Coding is a driving force for the future, and if you have the patience 
           required, you can be a part of that future. We will help you as much as we can, with our mentoring 
           service you really will come on. How cool would it be, to be able to say we helped the next founder 
           of a Facebook, Google or Apple.

            We only started this project to help you. Well that's not strictly true, because we need the next generation
            of coders to take over from us, when we want to hand over the baton. You can take your new found skill and put 
            it good use, the world needs coders! Yes that's true,  you can be one of them coders and get paid good money to! Always look to learn from every possible source, we are only one of them sources, 
            but a valuable part of your development.

      Your development as a coder will be enhanced by the support we can give you. We will be there for you as you develop 
      your applications. We will arrange help with your progress, giving you advise. If it is appropriate we may help with 
      handling services, you may need for your projects. We will not be coding and managing your application, you will be, 
      but the helping hand we can give you will be a real advantage for you. We will be offering face to face sessions, 
      get in touch with us for more details.
