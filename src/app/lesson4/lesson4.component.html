        You will have learned the most basic part of coding when you have completed this lesson. 
        The reason we say this is because the most basic needs of a program are:-
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1: Putting sequences together.</li>
        <li>2: Working with variables.</li>
        <li>3: Loop though code.</li>
        <li>4: Make decisions in IF statements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is lots more  but you are starting to get to know Scratch by now. 
        You should be able to think of a small program you can make for yourself. 
        This is a big step along the way a proficient coder. So very well done. ãƒƒ

      An IF test  will always have a result of true or false. Like 1 = 1 will be true 
      and 1 = 2 will be false. This will sound very strange, because 1 = 1 of course it does - 
      but we are just making a point. In fact, when we are testing code we will use 1 = 1 when 
      we need to guarantee a true response and similarly 1 = 2 when we need a false response. 
      We will have a lesson on how to get your code working well later. We call finding mistakes 
      in your code 'debugging'.
