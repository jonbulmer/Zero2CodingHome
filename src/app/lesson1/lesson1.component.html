<div>
  <h2>Go and get Scratch. Its free!</h2>    
</div>
<div>
     <p>
     So this is the start of the journey to becoming a coder. First thing we need is our coding environment and what is better to start with than Scratch.
     You have 2 options the 1st is the desktop version. The 2nd option is the online version.<br />
    </p>
</div>    
<div>
  <h2>Option 1 Scratch 1.4 Desktop</h2>
</div>     
<div>
  <p>
    Please make sure you get the right download. You will have a <span id="OS">xx</span> operating system. So you want 
    <span id="scratchdownload">xx</span> for this machine, you can get this here.

    <h2>Option 2 Online Scratch</h2>

     <p>
      Click on the picture above to go to the Scratch website. When you see the menu bar on the top of the page, 
      you then need to click on 'join'. You will go through the 'create an account' process. Also, you will need to get an 
      account on the Scratch web site so you can store your projects. You will see the thee screens below.
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
      After you have got your account you will see the 'create' button on the menu bar. This is where you can code online, 
      and you can get an offline version too. We will not cover this right now, but if you want us to, we will put a guide together. 
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
      You will find lots of cool stuff on this site, so have a good look around! If you have seen enough here you can just crack 
      on with our friends at MIT Scratch. So now, please enjoy,
      </p>

        We hope we helped. Please keep looking at our site. ãƒƒ

     <h2>The desktop version</h2>
   </div>
   <div>
     <img scr="/scr/app/shared/images/standard/costume.gif">
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
      The section on the left is full of 'command' blocks, which you will need to join together. This will make your programs under the 
      'script' tag. You just drag a block with your mouse. Please see the picture below.
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>
     <img src="/src/app/shared/images/lesson1/JoinBlocks.gif">
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
      You will see a section in the middle. The 'script' tag is selected on the picture above the scratch programming environment. 
      This is where the code blocks will go. We can see the drawing of the cat in the 'costume' tag. The costumes are numbered 1 and 2, 
      this is important, but we will cover that later. Click on 'edit' and play about with it. You can't do any harm and its fun!

     <h2>Working with the stage</h2>
   </div>
   <div>
     <p>
      The next section is the 'stage'. As the name would suggest, it is where all the action in you program happens. We start with the 
      stage and the sprite. We call these 'objects', and you will see us create all sorts of different objects as we develop our programs, 
      learning how to code as we progress.
     </p>
   </div>
   <div>

   <div>
     <p>
      Take a look at the three icons. When you click the first icon the stage is very small, 
      but when you click the second icon, the stage is larger, while the third icon takes over 
      the whole screen. The icon on the black background will return you to the Scratch environment.

      The online version is almost the same as the desktop version, there are only some slight differences. 
      All the examples we will give you will be in the desktop version. A rule we follow is:-

        "You can load a project in the desktop version on to the online version, but not the other way around."

      We will want offering support to schools, that will be licensed. The support will consist 
      of a teacher contact and we will attending classes, this will be a professional with a 
      good standard of knowledge in the coding platform. We will work with the teachers with 
      development plans for each child, taking into consideration the network available to that 
      individual school. We are and will continue to develop software, that will backup the work 
      with the children This service will need to be subject to regulation and as such, we are 
      first looking for interest in this service, working with the appropriate body to ensure the 
      service is up to standard.
