      you then need to click on 'join'. You will go through the 'create an account' process. Also, you will need to get an

      After you have got your account you will see the 'create' button on the menu bar. This is where you can code online, 
      and you can get an offline version too. We will not cover this right now, but if you want us to, we will put a guide together.
