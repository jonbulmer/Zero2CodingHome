    <h1>Lesson 3 FOR loops and the Clock Project</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>What are FOR loops?</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>We have seen FOR blocks before</h3>
</div>

        We used a FOR loop in the last project, we did in the lesson walkaround1. 
        The cool kid moved along the path.Without the loop we would have to work out how far
        wee wanted the cool kid to go and we could only run that bit of code once.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember the variables from the last lesson we are using them here. The variable starts
        with the number 1 stored in it. Every time the loop goes around we add 1 to it so the kid moves
        1 step to the right on each FOR loop.  
    </p>

        So now we can put code together in sequences, and can work with the variables. This is great but 
        you should be seeing us doing the same thing over and over again. If we look at the code in the 
        first demo we looked at sequences. It would be better if it could go in a FOR loop as we can see 
        in the above picture. Now you only have to write the sequence once when it is written in a loop.

        You will understand this or you may need more help, 75% will need more help. Ada and Alan are 
        always happy to explain. The point here is we are using a loop to read a word left to right. 
        Think back to the variable lesson where we went through the letters in a numbered box. (We 
        count through them in our 'thisnumber' variable.) can you see it getting 1 added to it every loop. 
        Also when this count gets to the number of letters in the word we entered it will exit the loop. 
        When you get this you are well on the way to becoming a coder. WELL DONE ãƒƒ

    <h3>Setting everything up.</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Lets have a look at the setup part of this code. It is important to set everything up so when you run though 
        the code everything is how you expect it. In this case we are setting all the strings to the value of '' 
        (we call this empty string) and all the numbers to the value of 0. Please go back to lesson 2 if you are unsure 
        what is and how we use variables. When we have done all this we use the light blue ask blocks to ask 
        'What's your name?' You can see in the picture below the question is shown in the cats speech bubble, then the 
        user can type text into the enter text box at the bottom. The answer is held in the light blue answer holder, 
        this is in fact a special variable that can only be used for holding the text you enter. When you look at the 
        writting on the light blue ask and wait block, what that means is the code just waits for the user to click the 
        tick on the text box. When the user has clicked the tick box the WhatwasSaid variable is give the value that is 
        held in the answer holder. The last part of the set up is we set the thisnumber variable to the value 1. The 
        reason we have this is to count the letters in the text entered.
    </p>

    <h3>The work is done in the FOR loop</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The reason we use loops is to do the same thing many times. In this loop we will do the work until we have read 
        all the letters of the text entered. So let assume we entered 'Jon' as in the example above. We are going to 
        look at the words 'repeat until thisnumber > length of Whatwassaid', this is the way the computer can keep track 
        of how many letters it has read.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        As we saw in the set up we set the thisnumber variable to 1 and length of WhatwasSaid is a number that is the number 
        of letters in the text entered.        
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        So when we start thisnumber is 1 and the number of letters in whatwasSaid is 3  the > symbol means the value on the 
        left is more than the value on the right that is in the first case.
    </p>
</div>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Not more than 3</li>

        Can you make this clock tick. The time display will need to show the number the clock is pointing to. You have a clock sprite with the clock pointing at all 
        the 12 positions. The clock will run at one tick per second from the moment the green flag is clicked until the red spot is clicked. If you need more help
