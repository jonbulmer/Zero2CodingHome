1. Structure - why has code escaped the src folder?
2. Use of DisplayName attrib and razor view helpers good - nice logicless view (as it should be!)

3. StudentWithGrades vs StudentsGrades 
- strange naming scheme?
- StudentsWthGrades - could be all static?
- This is a view model, a static factory and some public utility functions - is that too many responsibilities?

4. StudentGrades.HasPassed - looping though char enumeration is an interesting approach - maybe vunerable to localisation impacts.
5. StudentGrades.ConcatenateStudentExams - string builder will offer negligible benefit here.  This doesn't quite match the example in format.
